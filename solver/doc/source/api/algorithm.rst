Lawson methods
--------------

This Lawson methods have a underlying Runge-Kutta method, they have the same name just prefixed by ``l``.

Lawson methods are build to solve a problem like:

.. math::

  \dot{v} = Lu + N(t,v)

First, we introduce the change of variable

.. math::

   u(t) = e^{-Lt}v(t)

which yields the equation

.. math::

   \dot{u}(t) = -Le^{-Lt}v(t) + e^{-Lt}\dot{v}(t)

which can be rewrite in term of :math:`u` as

.. math::

   \dot{u}(t) = e^{-Lt}N(t,e^{Lt}u) = \tilde{N}(t,u)

We solve this equation with a classical Runge-Kutta method RK(:math:`s`,:math:`n`) with :math:`s` stages and of order :math:`n`. We rewrite the scheme in term of the variable :math:`v`, which yields the following scheme

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
      k_i &= e^{-c_i\Delta tL}N(t^n+c_i\Delta t, e^{c_i\Delta tL}\left( v^n+\sum_{j}a_{i,j}k_j \right))\\
      v^{n+1} &= e^{\Delta tL}\left( v^n + \Delta t \sum_i b_i k_i \right)
   \end{aligned}
