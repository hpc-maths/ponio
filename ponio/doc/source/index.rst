=============================

.. note::
   ponio means *Presentation Overview of Numerical Integrator for ODE*, and of course it is also a reference to the animated film *Ponyo*.

The library ponio is a collection of time integrators for solving differential equations written in C++. The purpose of this library is to supply efficient and flexible C++ implementation of solvers for various differential equations. Main method classes are :

* explicit Runge-Kutta methods (eRK)
* diagonal implicit Runge-Kutta methods (DIRK)
* Lawson methods (based with an underlying Runge-Kutta method) (LRK)
* exponential Runge-Kutta methods (expRK)
* Runge-Kutta Chebyshev (RKC)
* splitting method (Lie or Strang)

This library aims to be the easiest to use without compromising on performance.
